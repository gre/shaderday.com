(see <em>main.rs</em>)</li>\n<li>GIF preview: I use a script to make a digital and theorical video of the animation. Very important for me to have an idea of the animation (even tho only plotting time will have the final surprise).</li>\n<li>plot first prototypes: I do some prototype plots to make sure the plot is good, specifically that the density chosen (number of lines) is well adjusted (too much and your paper starts to be comprised, not enough and you have too much gaps).</li>\n<li>I polish a lot the generator. Specifically on the different noise harmonies, frequencies and amplitudes.</li>\n<li>Once it&#39;s ready, i&#39;ll run a super script that loops over the &quot;video preview&quot; generation. It&#39;s time consuming as I will often stop and polish again the generator. This time it took me probably ten times to iterate like this. Literally the whole day.</li>\n<li>When I&#39;m confident, I&#39;ll generate a lot of video previews. <strong>This time I have generated 500 GIFs.</strong> It was very tricky to decide and to actually elect the final plot, I developed my own tool (see section below)</li>\n<li>Finally, I can plot them all, it takes a lot of caution on manipulating paper and fountain pens and a lot of manual actions. It is very time consuming but very rewarding. <strong>Each frame took more than an hour to plot with an AxiDraw robot.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"preview\">Preview</h3>\n<p>This is what the theorical art was going to be, this is a digital preview before doing the plot so indeed it only simulate what the actual ink was going to do. The physical art is better looking with the imperfections of the medium.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/143-theorical.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<h3 id=\"process-to-find-the-final-plot\">Process to find the final plot</h3>\n<p>As I&#39;m working with a generator, it can generate infinite variants of plot loops. I have generated 500 GIFs (virtual plot loops)</p>\n<p>It ended up being very tedious to try to find a good animation by manually going through the files so I literally developped an app to solve my problem and provide a voting system so I can compare in parallel different results and chose among them. It could be reused and improved in future, it&#39;s not yet &quot;generic&quot; but if there is a need for it, I would make it generic and open source it as a standalone tool.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/143-elector.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<h3 id=\"early-prototype-and-special-editions\">Early prototype and Special Editions</h3>\n<p>This prototype was done to adjust some plotting parameters, specifically the number of lines.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/143-prototype.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also made these 2 special editions one to offer a friend and one gift to buyer of one of my previous plot loop.
